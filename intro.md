# Java 11 to 18 Hands-on Workshop

**Introduction**


The goal of this Hands-on is to allow you to discover, on Oracle Cloud, some key features recently added to the Java platform.

To achieve this, you will use :

* Java SE 18, released on March 2022, 

* the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

It is expected that you have Java knowledge and some basic Linux skills (ex. edit files). During this workshop, you will also use Maven. The only thing you need on your side is an SSH client, a web browser, and a direct Internet connection.

ðŸ‘‰ Please use this <a href="https://bit.ly/signup-special-promo">form</a> to register your interest in getting "special" access to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. ðŸ‘ˆ
